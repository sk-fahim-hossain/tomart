          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Welcome to T-MART, where the magic of childhood comes to life! We
            are passionate about bringing joy and excitement to children and
            families through our curated collection of high-quality toys.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Our journey began with a simple idea: to create a one-stop
            destination for parents and gift-givers looking for the perfect toy
            that sparks creativity, imagination, and endless hours of play. At
            T-MART, we believe that play is an essential part of a childs
            development, and we strive to provide a diverse range of toys that
            cater to every age and interest.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            What sets T-MART apart is our commitment to quality and safety. We
            carefully select each toy in our collection, ensuring they meet
            rigorous safety standards and are made from non-toxic materials. We
            believe in providing not just toys but cherished memories that last
            a lifetime.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Our team consists of toy enthusiasts and experts who are dedicated
            to staying updated on the latest trends and innovations in the toy
            industry. We handpick each toy with great care, considering factors
            like educational value, durability, and, most importantly, the joy
            it brings to children faces.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            T-MART is more than just an online toy store; it is a community of

            play to inspire, educate, and create moments of pure delight.
